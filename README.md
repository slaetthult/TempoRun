# Astro Starter Kit: TempoRun

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

## TempoRun Basics:

### Grid (Flexbox)

The grid class contains the shortname of the viewport (defined in config.scss) and the amount of grids:
{viewport}{gridamount} -> "w12".
If you want to push or pull grid-elements, use "w-left-4" {viewport}-{direction}-{gridamount}. Grid-Elements are directly wrapped by the class "grid-wrap".

```
<div class="grid-wrap">
    <div class="w12">
        <h2>Grid example</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="w12 mw12">w12 mw12</div>
    <div class="w12 mw6">w12 mw6</div>
    <div class="w12 mw6 mw-left-6">w12 mw6 mw-left-6</div>
    <div class="w6 mw4">w6 mw4</div>
    <div class="w6 mw4">w6 mw4</div>
    <div class="w6 mw4">w6 mw4</div>
</div>
```
